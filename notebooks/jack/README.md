# Jack Kelly ECE 445 Spring'23 Lab Notebook
## 2/22/2023
### Objectives:
Met with team to work on the design document. 

### Completed:
We were able to finish the design document, as well as order parts for the project.


## 2/23/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with the TA and group to discuss the project, as well as complete the team contract

### Completed:
Team contract, TA meeting

## 2/27/2023
### Objectives:
Do the Design Review
### Completed:
Design Review

## 3/1/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with group to draft PCB design and figure out parts for the project.

### Completed:
Figured out what parts we are going with. Decided on a MOSFET relay for the lock power relay due to the faster response times and high gate impedence. 


## 3/5/2023
### Objectives:
Met with group to get a final PCB design so that we could place the order in the frist batch. We also met to revise the design document using the TA feedback.

### Completed:
Finished PCB design at home afterwards, mainly focused on placing and routing components.


## 3/7/2023
### Objectives:
Complete teamwork evaulation

### Completed:
Teamwork evauluation

## 3/9/2023
### Objectives:
Met with group to discuss any work to do over spring break.

### Completed:
I had no tasks to complete over spring break.


## 3/22/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with TA

### Completed:
Met with TA


## 3/28/2023
### Objectives:
Complete individual progress report.
### Completed:
Individual progress report.



## 4/6/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with group to solder first PCB, perform modular tests.

### Completed:
Realized many parts we needed were not available and would have to be ordered after partially soldering. Placed orders for these components and designed a revised PCB so that we could use through-hole diodes and microcontroller. The diodes in the supply center are all through hole, so this allowed us more flexibility in case we needed to change any of those. We were able to place these orders and get the revised PCB order in, and now needed to wait for the orders to come in.


## 4/13/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with group in order to solder PCB components on, now that we had the components we needed.

### Completed:
We were able to get the surface mount components soldered on, but we were unable to program because we had noa ccess to a programming header. We had previously placed an order for that, so we would have to wait for that to come in.


## 4/14/2023
### Objectives:
Meet with TA and afterwards finish PCB in 2070.

### Completed:
Finished soldering all components onto the PCB.


## 4/19/2023
### Objectives:
Get a working PCB together to run a test program, and ensure all inputs and outputs work.

### Completed:
Able to get every input to turn the LED on and get the microcontroller to run the lock. This means all components work and now we just need to get a program to combine them all working.


## 4/20/2023
### Objectives:
Set up a system to get the door handle to work as an input instead of breadboarding buttons. Determine correct threshold for knocking to work.

### Completed:
Got every function of the design to work completely integrated. 


## 4/24/2023
### Objectives:
Complete demo

### Completed:
Demo.

## 4/27/2023
