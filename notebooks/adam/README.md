## 4/6/2023
### Objectives:
- Solder and test first PCB
### Completed:
- Picked up small parts for soldering
- Ordered more components for our project, ordered more ATtiny85s with different footprints in case our second PCB did not come in on time
- Ordered a revised PCB, we need to fix one routing that was missed on the schematic for the microcontroller, the footprint for the microcontroller was wrong

## 4/13/2023
### Objectives:
- Solder and test PCB
### Completed:
- Used stencil to solder on surface mounted components
