## OBJECTIVES: I must find a group to work with and submit an RFA

After attending the first few lectures, I had decided to work with my present team members: Adam and Jack. Our RFA submission went relatively smoothly, although occurred right at the deadline. We went back and forth with the TAs until we were approved to submit. Immediately after we worked together on the project proposal for our Knock Turn Lock, meeting in person several times to hammer out the details before the deadline.

## OBJECTIVES: I must order parts and revise the project proposal and begin the design document

Adam and I met to discuss the parts we should order. It turns out our project proposal was not entirely adequate. We only had 2 of 3 high level requirements. I personally went in and added User Programmability/Security as the third requirement. Our tolerance analysis was also inadequate. I attempted to add more detail to the specifics of how our piezo sensor would need to operate in order to function within our Knock Turn Lock system. As I submit this entry, I am working in person with Adam and Jack on the design document. During this meeting we submitted the parts to the ECE department for ordering.
