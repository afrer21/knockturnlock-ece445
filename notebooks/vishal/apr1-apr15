## OBJECTIVES: I must work on the Knock Turn Lock and get it ready for demo, specifically the software portion
The majority of physical progress on the Knock Turn Lock is beginning to take place. I am excited to see our vision come to fruition in the coming weeks. Unfortunately the machine shop is unable to help us. This is entirely on us, as we did not meet with them before the deadline. They had said that they might be able to offer us assistance, but now that it is coming to it they have made it clear that we are on our own. Fortunately Adam is adept in these matters, having grown up in rural area and good with hardware fabrication. He is going to mount a door handle to plywood to act as the base of our operations. We have put in a new PCB order with a connection we missed as well as swapping the surface mount ATT TINY 85 for a through hole one.

## OBJECTIVES: I must finish the prototype for demo
We have found an error in our PCB order. The microcontroller is active high, and we have grounded it in our design. Thankfully this is an easy fix -- all there is to do is solder a wire to the back of the PCB from that pin in the ATT TINY 85 and connect it to power. The mock demo fast approaches, and we must get everyting working before then. Adam has created the base of our project demo by mounting the door handle. We work in earnest to finish the programming section -- specifically myself and Adam. Jack has wired up the door handle with exposed wire that will make connections with the brackets mounted into our physical base.
