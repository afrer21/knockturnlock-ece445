## OBJECTIVES: I must complete the individual progress report. 
During spring break I review various aspects of the design. Aware of the upcoming deadline of the indivdual progress report, I remain diligent in keeping abreast of the various developements of the knock turn lock. My role as a computer engineer as opposed to electrical engineer has been and continues to be to monitor the software progress of our project. I don't see any issues with the pcb but only cursorly review the schematics -- we do not put in an order for the second round PCBWay order. Our parts have yet to arrive, but when they do I will ensure that sensor verification is properly handled.

## OBJECTIVES: I must complete the individual progress report and incorporate feedback from the design review. 

Work on the individual progress report has begun in earnest. Since the design review our team has made a few changes to improve the overall function and utility of our project. Now, there is an LED that shall provide visual feedback during opereation for the user's ease of use. The feedback given on sensor verification has also been instrumental in the way I have planned to test the componenet. These details are paramount and are being expanded upon in great detail as I flesh out the individual progress report. I return in focus to the IEEE standards as well as HIPAA and ADA regulations. This is my domain and it is important that I describe how the Knock Turn Lock strives to maintain these standards.
