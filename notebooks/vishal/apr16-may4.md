## OBJECTIVES: Get through mock demos and complete Knock Turn Prototype for final Demo

We have to get the programming done. That is the main priority. This is myself and Adam's main priority. Our mock demo is this Thursday. For that demo we will not integrate into the plywood contraption Adam has built. We have eschewed the idea of physical buttons, and will just use contact pads. 

The mock demo has gone well. We are fully prepared for the final demo. We work on a powerpoint presentation to make the best impression of ourselves during the demo. Even though it is not required we think that it will be good for us to highlight the information we are presenting and the functionality of our product in the best way possible.

## OBJECTIVES: Complete final demos and final presentations and final paper

We are confident in ourselves going into the final demo, and as such it went very well. The final presentation went equally well. We are happy with our preparation and polish. Now we must just finish the final paper. The three of us work together swimmingly and complete it in just a few days. We checkout our lab stations and complete our lab notebooks.
